            <h2>What I did today...</h2>
            <p> Jennifer Petit / July 20th, 2022 </p>

            <p> In today's class we went on a scavenger hunt.</p> 
                <p>We seperated into seprate groups and we went and interviewed different people who work here about what they do, what does their department does, and how they use technology in their job.</p>
                <p>We interviewed someone from addmissions, we went to the dome and interviewed the guy that runs the dome, and when went to sims hall to intreview someone from public saftey.</p>
                 <p>I really enjoyed talking to the people here and I found it very intresting how everyone here takies on a differnt role to Syracuse what it is today.</p>
