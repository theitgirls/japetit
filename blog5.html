            <h2>What I did today...</h2>
            <p> Jennifer Petit / July 25th, 2022 </p>
            <p>In today's class we played a game called bias and bust. We spilt both sides of the classroom and each side we had to convince the speaker why we're right and why they should believe us indtead. 
                The first round was trying to convince a 5yr old that the world is not flat, the second round we tried to convice a 19yr old why America is better. 
                Then we would "bust" and try to prove the other side wrong. In both debates we used information about them to pursuade them. 
                For example, we used ca picture of a pizza earth to conince the 5yr old the world isnt flat. Overall bias or bust was fun and honestly very educational.</p>
