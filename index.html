           <p> I'm Jennifer Petit and I am a rising sophmore and I'm from Queens New York. 
            I decieded to take this class because im really intrested in computer science, in fact my dream job is to work as a computer software engineer at Google. 
            I'm mostly into computer programming, I already know Html, css, javascript, and python, which I thought myself. 
            In my free time i love to online shop, watch my favorite tv show, gilmore girls, and read. 
            Im really excited to be apart of this program and i cant wait to expand my knowledge in technology.  </p>
