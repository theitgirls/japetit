            <h2>My Post Title About Cryptology</h2>
            <p> Jennifer Petit / July 19th, 2022 </p>
           <p> Elizabeth S Friedman worked as a cryptanalyst for the U.S Navy from 1916, during the world war, till the day she passed away on October 31st 1980.
           She was the first female code breaker and one of her significant accomplishments was deciphering the enemies (the nazi) code in both World Wars,</p> 
           and she also helped solve international smuggling cases during Prohibition.</p>

    <h2> What I did today.... </h2>
<p> In class today we learned about cryptology and we learned how to encript and decript messages. 
    We also learned about women in cryptology and how they played a big roll in that field. In addition we used a workesheet to encript and decript our own words.
