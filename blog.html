           <p> Elizabeth S Friedman worked as a cryptanalyst for the U.S Navy from 1916, during the world war, till the day she passed away on October 31st 1980.

    <h2> What I did today.... </h2>
<p> In today's class we learned about AI and how it takes place in many aspects in our daily life, like siri, alexa, we even unlock our phones using AI. 
    We also used a website called teachable machine where we trained our own AI. 
    My partner and I trained our AI to differentiate the differnce between cats, dogs, and ferrets. It was a really intresting lesson for today!
