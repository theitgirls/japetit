            <h2>What I did today...</h2>

            <p>I believe an orginized, properly labeled, easy to read, and intresting topic makes a compelling chart. 
              The most intresting chart to me was the US Map of the Highest Paid Public Employees by State. 
              I found it most intresting because if you can see in the image below the highest paying job are mostly footbal and basketball coaches, so with this map you can really tell what America proitizes. 
              Out of the 50 states only 11 are non-coaches.
              Although being a sports coach has value there are so many other other jobs that take much more work than a football coach.</p>
