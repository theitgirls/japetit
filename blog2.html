  <h2> My Favorite HTML Tutorial </h2>
  <p>Jennifer Petit / July 21st, 2021 </p>
  <p>This video below is how to learn the basics of html. I really like this video because it easy to understand, quick, and givies you a general idea on how to code html.
    <p>In fact when I was learning how to code html a few years ago these are the type of videos that helped me the most. </p>

  <h2> What I did today... </h2>
  <p>Today me and my group made our own citizen science presentation. The goal of our project is to see if the weather affects the population of cardinals in the United States.
  The way we use technology is; the participants from all states to take photos of cardinals and send it to us along with the specific weather that day (sunny, shady, rain, or snow & temperature).
  We will compare the amount of cardinals in warmer weather in states (Florida, Arizona, and California) to the amount of cardinals in colder states (Alaska, Minnesota, and Montana)</p>
